/// @see Aho, Alfred V.; Corasick, Margaret J. (June 1975). "Efficient string matching: An aid to bibliographic search". Communications of the ACM. 18 (6): 333â€“340.
/// @see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aho%E2%80%93Corasick_algorithm
///
/// Compared to the implemenation proposed by Aho and Corasick, this one adds two small enhancements:
/// - This implementation does not stores output keywords associated to states.
///   It rather reconstructs matching keywords by traversing the branch of the tree backward (see ACM_get_match).
/// - This implementation permits to search for keywords even though all keywords have not been registered yet.
///   To achieve this, failure states are reconstructed after every registration of a next keyword
///   (see ACM_register_keyword which alternates calls to algorithms 2 and 3.)
/// - This implemtation keeps track of the rank of a registered keyword as returned by ACM_get_match().
///   This can be used as a unique identifiant of a keyword for a given machine state.

/// Usage:
/// 1/ Define the type ACM_SYMBOL with the type of symbols that constitute keywords. char or int should match most needs.
///    Either define ACM_SYMBOL direcly in the user program or include a user defines aho_corasick_symbol.h file.
///    E.g.:
///    - #define ACM_SYMBOL char (simple choice if the algorithm is compiled as a private module).
///    - #include "aho_corasick_symbol.h" (better choice if the algorithm is compiled as an object or library, and not as a private module).
/// 2/ Insert "aho_corasick.h"
/// 3/ Initialize a state machine: InitialState * M = 0;
/// 4/ Add keywords (of type Keyword) to the state machine calling ACM_register_keyword() repeatedly.
///    Notes: ACM_KEYWORD_SET can help initialize keywords with a single statement.
///           ACM_nb_matches() returns the number of keywords already inserted in the state machine.
/// 5/ Initialize an internal machine state to M: InternalState s = M;
/// Repeatedly:
/// 6/   Scan some text where to search for keywords, injecting symbols of the text, one at a time by calling ACM_change_state() on s.
/// 7/   After each insertion, call ACM_nb_matches() on the internal state s to check if the last inserted symbols match a keyword.
/// 8/   If matches were found, retrieve them calling ACM_get_match() for each match.
/// 9/ After usage, release the state machine calling ACM_release() on M.
///
/// Note if ACM_SYMBOL is a structure (does not apply for basic types such as int or char):
/// - An equality operator '==' with signature 'int eq (ACM_SYMBOL a, ACM_SYMBOL b)' should be defined
///   in the user program and the name of the function should be defined in macro ACM_SYMBOL_EQ_OPERATOR.
///   E.g.: #define ACM_SYMBOL_EQ_OPERATOR myequalityoperaor
/// - Keywords are passed by value to ACM_register_keyword().
///   Therefore, if ACM_SYBOL contains pointers to allocated memory,
///   - a copy operator '=' with signature 'ACM_SYMBOL copy (ACM_SYMBOL a)' should be defined in the user program and
///     the name of the function should be defined in macro ACM_SYMBOL_COPY_OPERATOR.
///   - a destructor operator with signature 'void dtor (ACM_SYMBOL a)' should be defined in the user program and
///     the name of the function should be defined in macro ACM_SYMBOL_DTOR_OPERATOR.
///
/// Compilation:
/// The algorithm can be compiled either as an object (aho_corasick.o) or as a private module (if PRIVATE_MODULE is defined in the user program).
/// If PRIVATE_MODULE is set in the user program, then:
/// - the implementation of the algorithm will be compiled in the same compilation unit as the user program, therefore without requiring linkage.
/// - the warning "The Aho-Corasick algorithm is compiled as a private module." is emitted during compilation.
